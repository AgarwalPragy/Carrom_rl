# Carrom_rl
> A Pygame+Pymunk Carrom Simulation Testbed for reinforcement learning.

## To Do

- Validation  
- timeout as parameter
- Printing score
- Initial Formation
- Better Wells
- Agent (Reachability) - better than random (100 + runs with random seeds) Scores and Timing
- text
- enception handle the connections, return error message with stuff to try in case it fails
- 5 sent, no reciece timeout 
- refactoring and naming convention
