# Carrom_rl
> A Pygame+Pymunk Carrom Simulation Testbed for reinforcement learning.

## To Do

- Validation - 
- Timing (half a second) (server time)
- Printing score
- Decrease size of Visualization
- Initial Formation
- Better Wells
- Separate 1 player and 2 player servers
- Agent (Reachability) - better than random (100 + runs)
- rn seed - server agent - make it deterministic and text
- enception handle the connections, return error message with stuff to try in case it fails
