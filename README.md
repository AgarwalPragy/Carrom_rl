# Carrom_rl
> A Pygame+Pymunk Carrom Simulation Testbed for reinforcement learning.

## To Do
Rest: 

- Agent [High]
- Initial Formation [TBD: low]
- C++? Bash? [Someone else]

Me:


- Pass messages to Player [TBD: High]
- Test if putting objects on the same point clashes [TBD: High]
- Separate 1 player and 2 player logic [TBD: High]
- Give Play function to students [TBD: High]
- Agent (Reachability) - better than random (100 + runs with random seeds) Scores and Timing [TBD: High]
- Better Wells/Visualization [TBD: med]
- Add delay and describe action in visualization [TBD: Med]
- Timeout as parameter [TBD: low]
- Printing score [TBD: low]



- Actual carrom [Later]
- Validation (To be done after actual carrom) (Accept precision of actions only upto a certain point)
- Stochasticity [Later]
- Striker going in to hole rules of carrom [Ask Sir]
- Exception handle the connections, return error message with stuff to try in case it fails - [If required]
- Deep_rl? Images as state [Later]
- Player 2 agent [Ask Sir]
