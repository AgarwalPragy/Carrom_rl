## Introduction

This is the 0.1 release of Carrom_rl - A Carrom Simulator, which provides an interface, that allows you to design agents that play single player, and two player carrom. This is the course project for [CS 747 - Foundations of Intelligent and Learning Agents](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/cs747-a2016/index.html), taught by [Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/)  at IIT Bombay.

Feedback/suggestions/bugs are welcome.

## Carrom

You are given a board (screenshot)
The objective of the game is to sink all of your pieces, using the heavier 'striker', in any of the pockets before your opponent. 
The full list of rules and regulations can fe found at


### Why Carrom? 

It is a challenging domain in the artificial intelligence context:

- The state space  is continious
- The action space is continious, with added noise
- The agent must adhere to the rules of carrom
- In the two player case, the agent must plan a strategy against an adversary, making it a multi agent system

Also, Carrom is uniquely Indian!

## Rules
We slightly modify the rules of the game to make it suitable for learning. 

### 1 Player Server
The goal of the 1 Player server is to clear the board as fast as possible.

### 2 Player Server
