# Carrom_rl
> A Pygame+Pymunk Carrom Simulation Testbed for reinforcement learning.

## To Do
Rest: 


- Initial Formation [TBD: low]
- C++? Bash? [Someone else]
- Add delay and describe action in visualization [TBD: Med]
- Printing score [TBD: low]
- Agent [High]

Me:

- Fix Foul Logic [Done]
- Fix Scores Bug [Done] 
- Better Wells/Visualization 
- [TBD: med] Fix moving Holes Bug [Done]
- Separate 1 player and 2 player logic [TBD: High]
- Agent (Reachability) - better than random (100 + runs with random seeds) Scores and Timing [TBD: High]


- Actual carrom [Later]
- Validation (To be done after actual carrom) (Accept precision of actions only upto a certain point)
- Stochasticity [Later]
- Striker going in to hole rules of carrom [Ask Sir]
- Give Play function to students [TBD: High][Ask Sir]
- Optimize for speed
- Verbose tag
